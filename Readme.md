### Egg Entity Tracker for Forge
This mod simply draws a red line between the player and eggs within a large radius. The plugin was designed as a proof of concept "_cheat_" for Easter egg hunt style games on popular servers.

### Limitations
Minecraft seems to only render items within a very short distance of the player (I could be wrong, this is my first Forge mod) which means that no matter what the `RADIUS` variable is set to it won't show all eggs in that radius.

### Warning
This mod will probably get you banned from whatever server you use it on if you are discovered with it. I wrote this just as a proof of concept and have not used it on any public servers. __Use at your own risk!__
